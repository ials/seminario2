In this  week, we will follow the ["SAR-based land cover classification tutorial"](http://step.esa.int/docs/tutorials/S1TBX%20Landcover%20classification%20with%20Sentinel-1%20GRD.pdf)


## 👨‍🏫 Tutorial Dataset 

### Two options for downloading it:

####  [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus) 

#### [Alaska Satellite Facility](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/) 

*In both cases, you need to register*. 

#### Search and download the following products:

S1A_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20180220T165225_20180220T165250_020693_023723_FB7D

archive which means that products of older acquisition dates have to be requested first.
