    "text": "Coherence change detection using Google Colab\n\nAuthor: The WB Global Operational Support Team (GOST)\nThe interferometric coherence allows to measure the degree of similarity between 2 SAR images acquired using the same geometry in different times. Hence, the coherence map that generates can be used to analyse changes occurred on the mapped area during the observation period. The Coherence Change Detection uses 2 coherence maps computed using 3 SAR images to analysed the changes between them. The SAR images should be acquired: 2 prior crisis event and 1 posterior to the event. Strong changes observed in short time period are typically related to changes on crop fields and other phenomena, such as natural disasters, but also disasters that could occurred due to anthropogenic causes (i.e. explosions, etc).\nAn ilustrative example of this application is the analysis of the Beirut area affected by the blast occured in its harbor area last 4th August 2019. In red colour the area affected by a significant drop of the coherence values before and after the explosion event.\n\n\n\n\nThe GOST workflow\nThe GOST repository provides resources and examples to help you leverage SAR data using Coherence Change Detection using Google Colaboratory environment.\nThe available Jupyter Notebooks cover the installation of the necessary open tools (i.e. the ESA SentiNel Application Platform), the satellite data download (which requires previous user registration), interferometric coherence computation and post-processing steps, needed in some of the user input parameters, providing finally a Coherence Change map in an exportable webmap or GeoTIFF.\nThe Jupyter Notebooks follow the workflow illustrated below, indicating, when the user input is needed.\n\n\n\nThe implemented framework to get Sentinel-1 ARD includes additional border noise removal, speckle filtering, and radiometric terrain normalization. All the additional preprocessing can be adjusted by the user depending on their specific needs.\n\n\nHands-on exercise\nClick here to get the Jupyter notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resource\n\n\n\n\n\nCoherence Change Detection presentation\n\n\n\n🎥"

    "text": "Preparing Sentinel-1 Analysis Ready Data in GEE\nGEE provides global-scale and analysis-ready earth observation data and the cloud computing infrastructure required for their analysis. For SAR imagery, however, Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is a concept that can vary by application.\nWhile radiometric terrain normalization is a recommended preprocessing step for most applications, may not be conducted due to the absence of reliable DSMs. The Sentinel-1 SAR data ingested in GEE is limited to thermal noise removals, data calibration, multi-looking, and range-doppler terrain correction.\nFor a range of applications, it is advantageous to do additional preprocessing steps, such as speckle filtering and radiometric terrain normalization. However, expert knowledge is needed to implement the additional preprocessing steps.\nThus, in order to support additional Sentinel-1 SAR data preprocessing in GEE, Adugna Mellisa et al. (2021) proposed a comprehensive framework for preparing Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter ARD in GEE suitable for a wide range of applications.\n\n\nThe Mullisa workflow\nThe implemented framework to get Sentinel-1 ARD includes additional border noise removal, speckle filtering, and radiometric terrain normalization. All the additional preprocessing can be adjusted by the user depending on their specific needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nHands-on exercise\nThe framework is implemented in both GEE Javascript and the Python application programming interface (API).\nTo use the framework in GEE code editor, go to this repositorz and copy the contents of the s1_ard.js script to your own repository. The path to the preprocessing functions is a public so you don’t need to copy them.\nWhen using the Python API, the user should adjust the script path and GEE id to their own path and id before processing.\nClick here to try it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMullisa’s paper\n\n\nMullisa’s repository\n\n\n\n\n🎥"
